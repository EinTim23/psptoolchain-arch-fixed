# pkgconf Code of Conduct

We invite and encourage everybody to express their opinions on relevant
topics.  All participants should at all times feel at ease to do so without
fearing any form of attack, reprisal or harassment.  We ask everybody to be
respectful and considerate towards each other, especially when attempting
to provide constructive criticism.

To foster tolerance, respect and hospitality in our community, we agree not
to engage in discriminatory, disparaging or offensive speech or actions,
including as to (but not limited to) gender, sexuality, race, nationality,
religion or profession. We are a community of many different nationalities
and backgrounds, and we cherish our strength in diversity. 


## Reporting incidents

Please report any incidents which may be perceived as violations to
`ariadne+conduct@dereferenced.org`.  Incidents will be investigated and,
if warranted, acted upon.
